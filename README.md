# Research Internship Work
This is my project I developed during my research internship in the Department of Computer Science, University of York, and was overseen by Dr Pengcheng Liu.

My project focussed on the development and fine-tuning of autonomous and assisted exploration algorithms.
These were tested on a physical TurtleBot3 in the Real-Time Systems Laboratory as well as through Simulations in RViz and Gazebo.
